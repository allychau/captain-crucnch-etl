### Project Proposal
For our project proposal we will be analyzing country income level and their respective happiness. We plan on building a database which has country economic data as well as how the country has scored in the UN’s global happiness survey. Our data sources will include: the world happiness index and global economic data.

### Background
The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. The first report was published in 2012 and has continued annually since then. Today, the report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

Happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The scores are from nationally representative samples for the years 2013-2016 and use the Gallup weights to make the estimates representative. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

### Project Guidelines:
Finding Data: Use 2 or more sources of data. We recommend the following sites to use as sources of data:    

* [data.world](https://data.world/)
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* APIs or data scraped from the web
### Data Cleanup & Analysis
Once you have identified your datasets, perform ETL on the data. Make sure to plan and document the following:

* The sources of data that you will extract from.
* The type of transformation needed for this data (cleaning, joining, filtering, aggregating, etc).
* The type of final production database to load the data into (relational or non-relational).
* The final tables or collections that will be used in the production database.

### Project Report
 
At the end of the week, your team will submit a Final Report that describes the following:
1. 	Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
2. 	Transform: what data cleaning or transformation was required.
3. 	Load: the final database, tables/collections, and why this was chosen.
